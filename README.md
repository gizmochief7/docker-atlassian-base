atlassian-base
==============

The atlassian-base container is used as the base container for all of my other
Atlassian® software containers. This image probably shouldn't be used directly.
Instead, a child container containing the desired Atlassian® application should
be used.


Atlassian® Software Containers
------------------------------

The following pre-made containers are built and ready for you to use:

* [Confluence®](https://github.com/jleight/docker-atlassian-confluence)
* [Atlassian Crowd®](https://github.com/jleight/docker-atlassian-crowd)
* [JIRA®](https://github.com/jleight/docker-atlassian-jira)
* [Atlassian Stash™](https://github.com/jleight/docker-atlassian-stash)

Please read the individual container's README.md for more information.
